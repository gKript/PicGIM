# What is PicGIM
**PicGIM** is a "_modular library from scratch_".  
**PicGIM** is developed to work with **PIC18F MCU family** only and with **C18 compiler**.   
**PicGIM** will compile only the modules enabled.   
Through a set of public files, you can configure **PicGIM** molding it to your project having the most help in programming with **a minimum amount of program memory and ram** .   
Compiling **PicGIM** only with compulsory modules only **takes about 250 bytes of program memory**.   
It is compatible with **Microchip MPLAB 8** and with the new **Microchip MPLAB X**.   
One of the advantages of **PicGIM** is just to work with a **MICROCHIP STANDARD ENVIRONMENT**.   
You are completely free with **PicGIM**.   
You can choose to use totally or partially the support provided by **PicGIM**.   
Each module of **PicGIM** can be replaced by personal libraries.   
* **Anyone** is free to contribute to the development of **PicGIM**.   
* For _improvements_, _corrections_, or _to extend hardware support_, please contact us at this email : info@gkript.org 

# What is PicGIM for
**PicGIM** is **essential** in a project in order to dedicate all available time only to the main algorithm.   
So you no longer have to think about the management of timers, pwm or display, and even interrupts.   
Through this clear documentation you will know the full potential of **PicGIM**.   
What remains is to configure **PicGIM** carefully to get the best possible result.
